			<h1>What?</h1> 
			<br>
			<p>
				I co-founded a club dedicated to 3D-designing with my friend. We held 
				meetings to teach members how to do 3D-design using Fusion 360. We also 
				created videos on YouTube to show them how to do certain models. 
			</p>
			<br>

			<h1>Why?</h1>
			<br>
			<p>
				We had a tech design course in our high school, however it only taught 
				AutoCAD. I realized that this wasn't the greatest because 3D-designing is 
				an important aspect of engineering, and not everything is going to be done
				in AutoCAD. Everything that surrounds us; your water bottle, your monitor, 
				all the things in front of you, were all 3D-designed at one point before 
				production. This being said, I realized this was important and I raised 
				this with one of my tech teachers and he fully agreed with me. The rest 
				was history.

			<h1>Challenges</h1>
			<br>
			<ul>
				<p>
					It was a great challenge running this club under the entire COVID-19 
					situation, and I still can’t believe we somehow kept the club running 
					when school was fully remote. Running this club under COVID-19 taught 
					me about perseverance and how to improvise when things don’t go your 
					way. We were still able to successfully teach and inspire students 
					about 3D-designing over this tough time, and they continued their 
					commitment throughout their following years in high-school. 	
				</p>

			<h1>YouTube</h1>
			<br>
			<p>
				As mentioned, we created YouTube videos for our club members. You can check out
