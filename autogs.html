			<h1>What?</h1> <br>
			<p>
				AutoGS, short for Automated Greenhouse System, was our culminating project 
				for Grade 12 computer science. It consists of a glass tank with features 
				like controllable LEDs for lighting, sensors (temperature, humidity, moisture), 
				and automatic watering with the help of a water pump.
			</p>
			<br>

			<h1>Why?</h1><br>
			<p>
				My friends and I wanted to do a project that we thought was cool, although 
				it was beyond our knowledge and set of skills at that time. I will highlight
				this in the “Challenges” section. There was not any certain reason on why we 
				chose this project, but we knew that we did not want to do some common project
				like a game on Unity or some “basic” project.
			</p>

			<h1>Challenges</h1><br>
			<ul>
				<p>The first challenge was doing the project idea itself, because I was
					picking up programming back up and I was pretty much a beginner at that 
					point. I had no knowledge of Arduinos, electrical components, breadboarding, 
					and so forth. This project idea seemed impossible, or atleast, very
					challenging for a first’s beginner project. Either way, my friends and I 
					stuck onto it. We took our first steps by ordering an Arduino kit and doing 
					a lot of learning through YouTube and Googling. 
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>Besides technical challenges, it was not a personal project. I was working 
					with my teammates, my friends. We had different ideas, so there were some 
					discussions and conflicts on what we should do. This allowed me to work on 
					leadership and communication skills, along dealing with situations when 
					ideas conflict and both parties are stuck on it. 
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>I worked on the front end and circuitry, while my friends worked on the back 
					end of the project. After completing our parts, the next challenge was 
					integrating everything to make the system work. It took more communication 
					and problem-solving to get the automated greenhouse system working. 
				</p>
			</ul>
			<br>

			<h1>Result</h1>
			<ul>
				<p>
					The result was an actual working automated greenhouse system; what we, or 
					atleast I, thought was nearly impossible at the beginning, now exists and 
					works. My team and I finish off our computer science class with a high grade
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					We gave the greenhouse to our outdoors teacher for his class
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>Last but not least, this project was the beginning of my interest in learning 
					about electronics and programming; also what shifted my interest in doing 
					mechanical engineering to mechatronics engineering. I recognize this project 
					as one of my biggest moments for my career, and what started it all.
