			<h1>What?</h1> 
			<br>
			<p>
				An attachment to a tap wrench that uses an IMU (inertial measurement unit), 
				specifically the gyroscope part to track the angular position of the tap in 
				space. A button and RGB LED allows the user to set the position by pressing 
				the button, and the RGB LED provides feedback on how straight they are tapping 
				through the hole by representing green for “aligned”, and becomes more red as 
				they deviate from the true position they set by pressing the button. By finding 
				the true position of the hole, a cone part is inserted into the tap wrench 
				until it fits. Then, the user can set the position and produce a well-aligned 
				tap. 
			</p>
			<br>
			
			<h1>Why?</h1> 
			<br>
			<p>
				When I took manufacturing in high school, we were taught how to do tapping 
				manually. A critical aspect of tapping by hand is making sure that the tap is 
				aligned to the hole, because you do not want a thread that goes sideways, 
				especially when you screw in something. The Vertap project is directed towards 
				high school students or anyone trying to learn manual tapping.
			</p>
			<br>

			<h1>Process</h1>
			<br>
			<p>
				The first step in the process was taking a tap wrench, and measuring its 
				dimensions. This allowed to design and create the cone plunger part in 
				SolidWorks
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				Next step was acquiring a microcontroller and IMU. For the prototype, I 
				am using an Arduino Nano and a MPU-6050. I previously used a MPU-9250, 
				another IMU produced by the same manufacturer.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				Afterwards, the coding part comes along. I need to get the IMU outputting 
				raw data and ensuring the data output makes sense (the gyroscope values 
				spike when I shake the prototype)
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				To complete the prototype, I wire up a button and a RGB LED to the IMU. I also 
				program it in the Arduino IDE. I program the button to set the position and 
				the LED to change its colour to show how close you are to the position it was 
				set to, as talked about in the “What?” section
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				Currently I am working on the project, I am thinking of creating a more 
				advanced program and my own library for the IMU, to learn more about the 
				entirety of the process of working with IMUs (reading datasheets, low-level 
				programming, bit manipulation, etc.)

			<h1>Current Challenges</h1>
			<br>
			<ul>
				<p>
					First challenge is filtering the raw data that the IMU outputs. Research 
					has to be done (how they work, and how to implement). I am currently 
					looking into Kalman filters, although that might be a little more complex
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					The RGB LED drastically changes from green to red, so an algorithm must be 
					carefully designed to output the colours smoothly (no rough transitions). 
					Since the IMU outputs raw data, the LED is susceptible to the noise from the 
					gyroscope which could be one of the reasons with the LED issue
				</p>
			</ul>
