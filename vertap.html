			<h1>What?</h1> 
			<br>
			<p>
				An attachment to a tap wrench that uses an IMU (inertial measurement unit), 
				specifically the gyroscope part to track the angular position of the tap in 
				space. A button and RGB LED allows the user to set the position by pressing 
				the button, and the RGB LED provides feedback on how straight they are tapping 
				through the hole by representing green for “aligned”, and becomes more red as 
				they deviate from the true position they set by pressing the button. By finding 
				the true position of the hole, a cone part is inserted into the tap wrench 
				until it fits. Then, the user can set the position and produce a well-aligned 
				tap. 
			</p>
			<br>
			
			<h1>Why?</h1> 
			<br>
			<p>
				When I took manufacturing in high school, we were taught how to do tapping 
				manually. A critical aspect of tapping by hand is making sure that the tap is 
				aligned to the hole, because you do not want a thread that goes sideways, 
				especially when you screw in something. The Vertap project is directed towards 
				high school students or anyone trying to learn manual tapping.

			<h1>Current Challenges</h1>
			<br>
			<ul>
				<p>
					First challenge is filtering the raw data that the IMU outputs. Research 
					has to be done (how they work, and how to implement). I am currently 
					looking into Kalman filters, although that might be a little more complex
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					The RGB LED drastically changes from green to red, so an algorithm must be 
					carefully designed to output the colours smoothly (no rough transitions). 
					Since the IMU outputs raw data, the LED is susceptible to the noise from the 
					gyroscope which could be one of the reasons with the LED issue
				</p>
			</ul>
