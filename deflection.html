			<h1>What?</h1>
			<br>
			<p>
				The Grade 9’s taking the “Exploring Tech” course had an upcoming competition, 
				which was a popsicle bridge competition. Working with my tech teacher/mentor, 
				I designed and created engineering drawings for a deflection tester, or, the 
				bridge crusher, which consisted of a pneumatic tie-rod cylinder, I-Beam, and 
				many other components.
			</p>
			<br>

			<h1>Why?</h1>
			<br>
			<p>
				As I was working with my tech teacher who knew I was getting into 3D-designing 
				and leading the club, he wanted to prepare me for engineering at university and 
				give me more challenges and opportunities to grow as an engineering student. 
				Moreso, there was no suitable bridge crusher for the competition, so this raised 
				another designing opportunity for me. Alas, we got to work.
			</p>

			<h1>Challenges</h1>
			<br>
			<ul>
				<p>One of the challenges was being the designer, and having to come up with 
					logical decisions by yourself. Should I design it like this? That way? 
					I was communicating with my tech teacher/mentor over email, and I couldn’t
					 stuff every thought and question I had, so I had to take initiative and 
					 go with what I thought was the right or good decision for designing the 
					 deflection tester
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					After many iterations of doing the designing on Fusion 360, it was finally 
					time for creating the drawings. After creating drawings for each separate 
					component and the assembly itself, I had to get it reviewed by my mentor. 
					After he had reviewed and sat down with me to go over it, all I saw was 
					just red markings everywhere. There were a lot of improvements that the 
					drawings could have, and I learned a lot about doing mechanical drawings 
					after this.
				</p>
			</ul>
			<br>

			<h1>Result</h1>
			<br>
			<p>
				The competition was a success! They live-streamed it, and it was really cool to 
				see something I designed working in front of my screen, and being actually used 
				for a competition. The best part was seeing my creation destroying the popsicle 
				bridges that the Grade 9’s worked hard for. Jokes aside, the best bridge was able 
				to withstand over 500lb of force, which took first place by miles ahead!
